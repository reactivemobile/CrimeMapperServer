# CrimeMapperServer

This Node.js app is intended to reduce the network overhead of the Android, iOS and Scala apps. 

First off I'm stripping the stop-and-search information from the ```crimes-street-dates``` endpoint.

Next will be (perhaps) modifying the response to include the category mapping for crime report categories.

Finally the apps will be updated to handle the new endpoint.
